# Goodeed

Goodeed is an App that I created for those that want to store and share good moments and good deed actions. It proposes to be a place where the user can feel happy and hopeful that the world can be and is a better place. Unlike other Apps, Goodeed is neither a daily nor a charity donation App. Goodeed records the userâ€™s good actions, either just for themselves or to share with their followers on the Goodeed network. The user can also tag every important moment in their timeline. 

The user can create their own motivational/inspirational quotes or paste their favorites, store photos and also know which was the best post and action that keeps them motivated and may motivate others in the Goodeed community. This Goodeed App project is a small contribution to help improve and make our World, our only one, a better place for all of us.
